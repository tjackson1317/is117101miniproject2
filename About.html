      <p>
        For years, I have worked in various roles dedicated to creating art and building community one experience at a
        time, most recently as producer and director of ThirdEye Productions during my tenure as a student at New Jersey
        Institute of Technology (NJIT). In December 2019, I will be graduating from NJIT with a major in Theater Arts
        and Technology and
        minor in business. It is my objective to continue supporting the arts by exercising and expanding my skills in
        production.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have built a strong interdisciplinary skill set distinctly suited to today’s equally artistic and scientific
        marketing discipline. I understand the importance of shaping the creative process with data enabled by new
        technologies and business
        strategy to ensure that marketing messages fully resonate with their audience and drive superior business
        results by “Winning with Purpose.” At the same time, as a playwright, director, and performer, I have a passion
        for the artistic aspect of marketing, understanding and empathizing with my fellow human beings on an authentic,
        emotional level as well as crafting compelling stories that engage and empower them.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career highlights include performing data analytics on KPMG’s internal collaboration
        software and presenting my findings to the firm’s leadership, developing innovative marketing campaigns with a
        reach of over 300,000, and managing budgets of over $400,000. Outside of work, I love watching films, reading,
        and spending time with my family and friends.
